# Introduction
This is the second project of SDC term 2. In term 1 we used extended Kalman filter to predicate the position of a moving object. In this project utilize an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements and it can archieve a better result.
